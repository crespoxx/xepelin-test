# Xepelin Technical Test

This repo consists in a simple app made in React. It uses Firebase to manage user authentication and finally it has an embedded Gsheet where you can edit it. In this Gsheet are shown all the values of the rates of each operation and the email of the responsible of these operations. If one of these rate values are edited, a new email is going to be sent to the person responsible for that particular operation. The triggering of the email will only occur when a rate is modified, the other fields will not trigger the event.
